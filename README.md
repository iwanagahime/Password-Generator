## Description

We were asked to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## What did we do?

- Declared variables for character choices in global memory
- Declared generatePassword function that was constructed as a series of steps including:
- Prompting user for password length
- Using confirm to let user specify their choices
- Using alert to make sure that user sets the correct password length and chooses at least one character type
- Declaring a new array for user's choices
- Using a for loop to generate characters for our password
- Using Math.floor function to generate random character from random array to form our password
- Converting the randomly generated characters from an array into a string
- Returning the generated password to the user in browser
- Format code using prettier
